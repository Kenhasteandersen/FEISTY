# FEISTY

Implementation of the FEISTY fish model framework. Currently just barely functional.

---

Todo:

- Implement the interaction matrix between the species and the resources
- Make `plotSpectra` do proper Sheldon spectra
- Add proper legends to `plotSSBtime()`
- Add depth-slider to app
- Implement proper correct of bin width for size-selection of prey
- Implement temperature
- Make a food-web flux diagram
- Make a plot of the internal fluxes in each group (feeding level, predation mortality)
