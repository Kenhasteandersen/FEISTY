Todo:

- Implement the interaction matrix between the species and the resources
- Fix the levels of primary productivity
- Implement background mortality
- Add proper legends to plotSSBtime
- Add depth-slider to app
- Implement temperature
- Make a food-web flux diagram
- Make a plot of the internal fluxes in each group (feeding level, predation mortality)
