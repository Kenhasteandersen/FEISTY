\title{Spawning Stock Biomass Calculation}
\usage{
calcSSB(sim, etaTime = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{The FEISTY simulation result list from \code{\link{simulateFEISTY}}.}

\item{etaTime}{The last fraction of the simulation period (default the last 40\%).}
}
\value{
Add SSB data to the result list:
\itemize{
\item SSBMean: a vector containing the mean SSB data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type of the time range specified.
\item SSBMin: a vector containing the minimum SSB data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type within the time range specified.
\item SSBMax: a vector containing the maximum SSB data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type within the time range specified.
\item SSB: a matrix containing the SSB data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type (column) in each time point (row)

\description{
This function calculates the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for each function type based on a FEISTY simulation result.
}
\details{
This function calculates the spawning stock biomass for each function type based on the FEISTY simulation results within the specified time fraction (default is the last 40\% of the simulation period). \cr
Spawning stock biomass is the product of biomass \code{u} [gww/m2] and maturity level \code{psiMature} [1/year]. Negative values in \code{u} are revised to 0. \cr
Note the SSB data only represents how much biomass (energy) could be used for reproduction, rather than the amount of offspring. \cr
This function has been integrated into \code{\link{simulateFEISTY}}. It cannot be called independently.
