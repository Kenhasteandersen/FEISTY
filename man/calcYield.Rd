\usage{
calcYield(sim, etaTime = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{The FEISTY simulation result list from \code{\link{simulateFEISTY}}.}

\item{etaTime}{The last fraction of the simulation period (default the last 40\%).}
}
\value{
Add yield data to the result list:
\itemize{
\item yieldAMean: a vector containing the arithmetic mean yield data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type of the time range specified.
\item yieldGMean: a vector containing the natural log-based geometric mean yield data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type of the time range specified.
\item yieldMin: a vector containing the minimum yield data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type within the time range specified.
\item yieldMax: a vector containing the maximum yield data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type within the time range specified.
\item yield: a matrix containing the yield data [gww/m2/year] of each functional type (column) in each time point (row)

\description{
This function calculates the yield for each functional type in units of gWW/m2/year based on a FEISTY simulation result.
}
\details{
This function calculates the yield for each function type based on the FEISTY simulation results within the specified time fraction (default is the last 40\% of the simulation period). \cr
Yield is the product of biomass \code{u} [gww/m2] and fishing mortality \code{mortF} [1/year]. Negative values in \code{u} are revised to 0. \cr
This function has been integrated into \code{\link{simulateFEISTY}}. It cannot be called independently.
